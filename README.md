# Elderly Care App - Android Development Project

## üì± Project Overview

This repository contains the progressive development of an **Elderly Care Application** built throughout a semester-long Android mobile development course. The project demonstrates incremental learning and implementation of Android development concepts, with each folder representing a weekly lesson and corresponding app prototype.

---

## üéØ Course Objectives

By the end of the semester, students are required to have:
- Developed a fully functional Android application
- Implemented core Android development concepts
- Applied weekly lessons to iterative app prototypes
- Demonstrated proficiency in Kotlin programming
- Utilized Android Studio for mobile app development

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

- **Primary Language**: Kotlin
- **IDE**: Android Studio
- **Platform**: Android Mobile Development
- **Project Type**: Progressive Learning Application

## üìÇ Repository Structure

This repository is organized by weekly lessons and practice implementations. Each folder contains a prototype or practice project that applies concepts learned in that specific week's Android development lesson.

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dice Roller/          # Practice project - Basic Android UI and interactivity
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Elderly_Care/         # Main project - Elderly Care Application (primary focus)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prac3/                # Week 3 practice - Android concepts implementation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prac4/                # Week 4 practice - Android concepts implementation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [Additional weekly folders as course progresses]
```

### Folder Descriptions

- **`Dice Roller/`**: Introductory practice project focusing on basic Android UI components, button interactions, and random number generation.

- **`Elderly_Care/`**: The main semester project - an application designed to assist elderly users with daily tasks, health monitoring, reminders, and connectivity features. This folder contains the most comprehensive implementation of all learned concepts.

- **`prac3/`, `prac4/`, etc.**: Weekly practice folders containing prototype implementations of specific Android development topics covered in each lesson. These serve as building blocks for the main Elderly Care application.

## üìö Learning Path

Each week focuses on specific Android development concepts that are incrementally applied to the Elderly Care app:

### Example Weekly Topics (Typical Android Development Course):
1. **Week 1-2**: Android Studio setup, Kotlin basics, Activity lifecycle
2. **Week 3**: UI components, Layouts (LinearLayout, ConstraintLayout)
3. **Week 4**: Event handling, Intents, Navigation
4. **Week 5**: RecyclerView, Lists, and Adapters
5. **Week 6**: Data persistence (SharedPreferences, Room Database)
6. **Week 7**: Networking, API integration
7. **Week 8**: Permissions, Location services
8. **Week 9**: Notifications, Background services
9. **Week 10**: Material Design, UI/UX polish
10. **Week 11-12**: Testing, Debugging, Final integration

*Each practice folder (`prac3`, `prac4`, etc.) corresponds to concepts learned in that specific week.*

## üßì Elderly Care Application Features

The main **Elderly Care** app aims to provide:

- **Medication Reminders**: Schedule and track daily medications
- **Emergency Contacts**: Quick access to family and medical contacts
- **Health Monitoring**: Track vital signs and health metrics
- **Simplified UI**: Large text, clear buttons, accessibility features
- **Daily Activity Tracker**: Monitor routines and activities
- **Video/Voice Calling**: Easy communication with loved ones
- **Location Sharing**: Safety features for caregivers

*Features are implemented progressively as new Android concepts are learned throughout the semester.*

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio (Latest stable version recommended)
- JDK 11 or higher
- Android SDK (API level 24+ minimum)
- Basic understanding of Kotlin programming

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. **Open in Android Studio**
   - Launch Android Studio
   - Select "Open an Existing Project"
   - Navigate to the desired folder (e.g., `Elderly_Care/` or `prac3/`)
   - Wait for Gradle sync to complete

3. **Run the application**
   - Connect an Android device or start an emulator
   - Click the "Run" button (Green play icon) or press `Shift + F10`
   - Select your target device

## üîß Development Workflow

### Weekly Practice Implementation
1. Attend weekly Android development lesson
2. Review concepts taught in class
3. Create new practice folder (`pracX/`) or update existing prototype
4. Implement learned concepts in isolated practice project
5. Apply successful implementations to main `Elderly_Care/` app

### Best Practices
- Write clean, commented Kotlin code
- Follow Android development guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Test on multiple device sizes/API levels
- Commit regularly with descriptive messages

---

## üìñ Documentation

Each folder may contain:
- **README.md**: Specific implementation details for that week's concepts
- **Code comments**: Inline explanations of key functionality
- **APK files**: Compiled application builds (if applicable)

---

## üß™ Testing

- Manual testing performed on Android emulators and physical devices
- Focus on user experience, especially for elderly users
- Testing across different Android API levels
- Accessibility testing (font sizes, contrast, touch targets)

---

## ü§ù Contributing

This is an educational project for a semester-long Android development course. Each student maintains their own repository with weekly updates based on class lessons.

### For Instructors/Reviewers
- Each `pracX/` folder demonstrates understanding of that week's topics
- Main `Elderly_Care/` app shows cumulative learning and integration
- Progression should be visible from early to later folders
